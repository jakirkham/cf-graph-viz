# cf-graph-viz
This is an initial graph vizualization of conda-forge's package dependency graph.
It uses the graph file generated by https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts. 

## Running
Just call `anaconda-project run`, open the `cf-graph-viz.ipynb` and execute the cells.
The bokeh plot at the end is interactive and hoverable.
